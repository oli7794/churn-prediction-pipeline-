ML pipeline to detect customer churn using multiple classifiers


# Churn Prediction Pipeline

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using various classification models (Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost). It covers the full ML workflow: data prep, feature selection, training, evaluation, and business impact analysis.

## 🔧 Tools & Tech
- Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas
- Jupyter, matplotlib, seaborn
- StandardScaler, chi-square, RandomForestClassifier

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/` – Modelling and EDA
- `src/` – Scripts for data prep and training
- `reports/` – Final report and visualisations

## 📊 Business Impact
Model identifies high-risk churn customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.
